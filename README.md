# BatchOpenSim
What: Batch Process multiples of walking biomechanical data (markers and ground reaction forces) through OpenSim musculosleletal modelling using the Matlab to OpenSim API

Why: automated processing of multiple trials speeds up processing time and reduces the likelihood of errors

Who: human biomechanics researchers, especially those studying walking while on a dual belt treadmill with embedded force platforms

How: as described in ___

Setup Configuration
- downladed Opensim (https://simtk.org/projects/opensim) and Matlab (https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html)
- setup OpenSim API, instructions at: https://simtk-confluence.stanford.edu/display/OpenSim/Scripting+with+Matlab


Input Requirements:
- matching .trc and .anc files for each trial recorded (matched by spelling)
- OpenSim model and set up files for each task (see OpenSimProcessingFiles)
